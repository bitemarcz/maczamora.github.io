Hi Everyone, I would like to formally welcome all of our readers to the Counter Comms blog. This is the first blog post and more to come as we wind down the end of 2021. I sometimes find myself asking why Counter Comms was created? What are we offering in terms of value? What type of readers are we attracting, and what can we help you with? This is not set and stone and can change anytime, and that's what we aim to do because disruption and change can happen at any time.

1. Counter Comms is not just a business, we are a brand, we are thinkers, we are pioneers and we are the embodiment of the past, present, and future builders constructing the software of tomorrow. Please check out this [brief interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2-c0NlskhA) with former Github CEO Chris Wanstrath, as he shares his opinions and excitement for software and its future.


2. We aren't just a technology company, we're a research focused brand. With experience in software engineering and development. We are sharing ideas and thoughts surrounding this infant industry. 


3. And this brings us to the last question. Counter-Comms is a small business, technology brand and a Blog. We deliver blog posts through expert lead research in hopes that you may find yourself asking, "What else is there to know about software?"
