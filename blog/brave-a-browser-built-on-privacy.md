Welcome back my readers and thank you to my customers who are re-occurring visitors. If you are finding any of this content interesting I wish I could provide a way for you to subscribe for notifications. Please be on the look out for a way to subscribe to the blog in the future and get notifications to new blog posts and content. 

If you would like a way to show some support or acknowledge that you are here as a customer and support my content you are more than welcome to leave a tip via the Brave browser, more on this later. What is Brave you might ask. Brave, it's another web browser like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or to the Apple fans, Safari. Brave is not like most browsers though, it prides itself on a privacy and blocks advertisements for you by default. 

Yes, this means you can fire up YouTube and avoid all of those annoying advertisements that delay you from watching the content you want to watch. Imagine if you you spent 2 minutes between every video you watched in a two hour time frame and let's say you watched over 25 videos. In two hours that's close to an hour of wasted time on advertisements that are **targeting** you. 

I repeat, you are a **target** to companies that are ingesting all of your data and making money off of you through click bait and possibly some other methods of revenue generating streams. The worst part about it, they own you and the data they gathered off of your browsing history and any other forms of navigation you perform.

That's okay though, I'm not here to scare you into migrating away from your current systems and lifestyle choices. This isn't some type of *FUD* (fear, uncertainty, doubt) blog post where I'm encouraging my readers to ditch the software and platforms they use. That would be wrong and unethical. However, I am here to tell you my experience with Brave and teach you how this migration has helped me in my endeavors and how it might help you as well. 

Immediately after using Brave for a little over two weeks I have felt like my privacy and data has been more protected. I've felt less pressure and less advertisements across different applications installed both on my smart phone and laptop at home. Brave does come with an advertisement feature that you may notice but you are able to turn this feature off completely through the settings. Here is three step process to turn them off:

1. You'll need to go to the top right cornet to select the options
2. Click settings form this menu
3. Click Brave Rewards from the top menu bar
4. Finally you'll see a section that says Brave Rewards and an option to turn off Ads. **NOTE!!!** You wont receive any BAT when turning this off.

Brave is completely free to use and you can earn up to about $5 of BAT a month depending on how many Brave ads you view and you can always leave this BAT to as a tip to Brave Creators you enjoy. This takes me back to the tips. I've recently enrolled in the Brave Creators program so any content I publish via Counter Comms can be supported via tips inside the Brave Browser. All you have to do is come to the Counter Comms home page and click the BAT symbol inside the URL bar. It'll look like the symbol pictured below:

It will show countercomms.com as a verified creator and you'll be able to setup re-occurring monthly contributions or provide one small tip. You will need to purchase BAT via a crypto platform like Gemini or Uphold. I would recommend checking out Gemini as I've heard some bad things about Uphold thus far. 

This takes me to my last point about Brave, it's a new world. You'll notice somethings around crypto currency, crypto, privacy, tokens, content feels a little more free and you also might find yourself browsing upon things you wouldn't normally stumble upon using Chrome or any other browsers using target ads. If you notice a change in your mindset and behavior you have successfully crossed over to a more private lifestyle. Congratulations!!!
