Hello, and thank you to my customers who are re-occurring visitors. If you're finding this content interesting, I wish I could provide a way for you to subscribe for notifications. Be on the lookout for a way to subscribe to the blog in the future and receive information on new blog posts and content.

If you would like to show support or acknowledge that you are here as a customer for Counter Comms, you are more than welcome to leave a tip via the Brave browser. What is Brave you ask? It's another web browser like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or to the Apple fans, Safari. Brave is not like most browsers though, it prides itself on privacy and blocks advertisements by default.

Yes, this means you can fire up YouTube and avoid all of those annoying advertisements that delay you from watching the content you want to watch. Imagine if you spent 2 minutes between every video you watched in a two-hour time frame and let's say you watched over 25 videos. In two hours that's close to an hour of wasted time on advertisements that are **targeting** you.

You're a **target** to companies that are ingesting all of your data and making money off of you through tracking and other browser-based tracking tools. The worst part about it, they own you and the data they gathered off of you.

I'm not here to scare you into migrating away from your current systems and lifestyle choices, this isn't some *FUD* (fear, uncertainty, doubt) blog post where I'm encouraging my readers to ditch the software and platforms they use. That would be wrong and unethical. However, I am here to tell you my experience with Brave and teach you how this migration has helped me in my endeavors and how it might help you.

Immediately after using Brave for a little over two weeks, I have felt like my privacy and data had been more disparate. I've felt less pressure and fewer advertisements across different applications installed both on my smartphone and laptop at home. Brave does come with an advertisement feature that you may notice, but you can turn this feature off through the settings. Here is a three-step process to turn them off:

1. You'll need to go to the top right cornet to select the options
2. Click settings form this menu
3. Click Brave Rewards from the top menu bar
4. Finally you'll see a section that says Brave Rewards and an option to turn off Ads. **NOTE!!!** You wont receive any BAT when turning this off.

Brave is completely free to use, and you can earn up to about $5 of BAT a month, depending on how many Brave ads you view. You have the option to leave BAT as a tip to Brave Creators you enjoy, this takes me back to the tips system built into Brave. I've recently enrolled in the Brave Creators program, therefore content I publish via Counter Comms can be supported via tips inside the Brave Browser. All you have to do is come to the Counter Comms Home page and click the BAT symbol inside the URL bar. It'll look like the symbol pictured below:

The pop-up will show www.countercountercomms.com as a verified creator. From this pop-up, you'll be able to set up reoccurring monthly contributions or provide one small tip at a single time. You will need to purchase BAT via a crypto platform like Gemini or Uphold. I would recommend checking out Gemini as I've read some bad things about Uphold thus far.


You'll notice more information around cryptocurrency, crypto, privacy, tokens and feel a little freer as you browse within Brave. Additionally, you might find yourself stumbling upon more content that gives you a sense of open freedom, and I think this is where a lot of the target ads come into play. If you notice a change in your mindset and behavior you have successfully crossed over to a more private lifestyle. Congratulations!!!
