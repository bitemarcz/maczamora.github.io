For today's blog post I want to welcome everyone to this new community. I won't hit you with any technology content today, but be prepared for my next blog post where we go over a powerful open source technology we call Linux! Quack Quack! 

This blog is new and being developed by me using [Jekyll.](https://jekyllrb.com/) Because of this, my plan is to release content one to two times a month to keep us hungry for more.

Please feel free to reach out for partnerships, collabs, or even if you just want to talk technology and need me to step in as a consultant.
