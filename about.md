print ("Hello World!") No pun intended but that's how you write a print statement in Python. This may not even be a pun. I'm Mario and I currently hold a position as an IT Solutions and Delivery Management Associate with a global market leader, [Keysight Technologies.](https://www.keysight.com/us/en/home.html)

I graduated with my degree in Computer Information Systems with an emphasis in Cybersecurity from [Colorado State University of Pueblo](https://www.csupueblo.edu/). All I can say is I'm a proud and humble pack member for life! This is where I would howl in my head and throw up the Thunderwolf hand sign. 

I enjoy technology and the ability it gives humans to transform the world. It's almost like a superpower, you can write software to build amazing products, implement new policies to drive IT security measures, or design and test new solutions to enable digital transformation. This industry really pushes the boundaries and anything is possible as long as you set your mind to it. 

The goal of (this blog) is to build, teach and empower a new community of technologists seeking to push the boundaries of their human ability and transform their lives through technology.
