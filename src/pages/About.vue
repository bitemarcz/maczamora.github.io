        <b-col cols="10"><h4 class="career">Career Background</h4>I graduated from CSU-Pueblo üê∫ wth a Bachelor's of Science in CIS (Computer Information Systems) with an emphais in Cybersecurity.
     During my time in college I worked as a Helpdesk Support Technician for a company called <a href="https://www.surfboard.com/">ARRIS</a>, and as a Network
     Admin Assistant for the Network and Server Systems department on campus. I got to participate in a campus network upgrade where I installed Wi-Fi Access Points and Switches suppported by 
     a company called <a href="https://www.extremenetworks.com/">Extreme Networks.</a> You can say that I had my fair share and time in the trenches. After graduation I was blessed to have 
     received a job offer from <a href="https://www.keysight.com/us/en/home.html">Keysight Technologies</a> as an IT Associate part of the first and last IT Rapid Rotation Program.</b-col>

        <b-col cols="10"> During this program I rotated between different areas within IT including Security Operations, Compliance, Infrastructure and Customer Applications. The initial plan of the program
      was for those in the cohort to go they're separate ways into a specific area of interest with the IT Organization. It was decided the 2019 cohort and 2018 cohort would combine and were
      asked to create the IT Agile Center of Excellence to deliver valueable software products using Agile values and principles using the Scrum methodology.</b-col>

        <b-col cols="10">It has been a journey as I've transtioned into a software role but it's  been both challenging and rewarding at the same time. I've gained a set of new skills and keep growing and learning every day.
       I've gotten to work on both successful and not so successful software products. Along the way I've picked up the ins and outs of working on a Agile Software Delivery Team. </b-col>
